# Purpose
To implement boardgame library and lend service that can be:
* used in Gramajda group,
* connected with main Gramajda site <http://www.gramajda.pl>,
* reused in other boardgaming groups.

# Already implemented features
* library: basic functionality,
* common: user authentication.

# Developing in progress
* lend: basic functionalities,
* common: ajax features (for example asynchronous boardgames listing and refreshing).

# Ideas to implement (from next ones)
* library: showing and selecting only specified library (for example Gramajda library as default),
* library-lend: moving whole library to specific lend event.
